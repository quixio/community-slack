# Slack Integration

Use the Slack Python API to retrieve Slack users, with the intention of keeping a rolling count of the number of members in a given community.
Use [Quix Streams](https://github.com/quixio/quix-streams) to create a window over the data, to count the number of unique users, every hour.
